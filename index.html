        <div class="subheading mb-5">EconomicsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Economics is a fascinating field that I've had the priviledge of studying at University of California - Riverside for the last 2 years. Through my studies and participation in extracurricular activities such as the Highlanders Economics Society (HEC) or Highlanders Action Committee (HAC), I've been able to broaden my personal and professional horizons towards better understanding and addressing the inequalities of our world and hope to one day work towards addressing them in whatever line or work I pursue. Law would be nice, education could be too, it's a good thing I still have at least 8 more quarters at this wonderful school to figure it out.  I also intend on declaring a minor in Public Policy, a process that has been delayed by the unfortunate timing of the last class I need to take to fulfill the prerequisites in order to do so, meaning I likely won't complete the process until either spring quarter or during my junior year. Recently I also joined my school's chapter of Phi Alpha Delta, a prelaw organization that both provides me with the incredible opportunity to meet a host of fascinating fellow students but also access to a wealth of information regarding the process of applying to law school and succeeding in law to begin with. I am eager to explore whatever opportunities come my way, as I'd rathe rnot miss out on the countless opportunities that UCR has to offer. Despite my initial dejection from not making it into other more preferred UCs, I've been very happy during my time at UCR and wish that there was more positivity surrounding our school and its reputation. 'UC Rejects' is such a poor label for a world renowned institution and I hope that by the time my own children are applying to college, my alma mater will have the same reputation as UC Davis or another campus that has gradually become a much more prominent name over time instead of the butt of the joke. That's what we have Merced for anyways.<br><br>

        On a related note, I was recently hired as a research intern at the Presley Center of Crime and Justice Studies on campus, which is a part of our incredible college of public policy. There, I'll work alongside fellow interns, professors, and other professionals to produce annual bulletins highlighting the studies of graduate students on the causes, effects, and recommended responses of and to crime in California. My previous work was with my local library system where I worked through the Big Lift Inspiring Summers program to help boost literacy levels among struggling students between grades K-3 to prevent irrevocable educational backsliding and to build academic confidence that will hopefully stay with them for the rest of their academic lives and beyond.<br><br>

        I find social impact work to be deeply rewarding and hope to continue working in said field beyond college to create a world more equitable and welcoming for this generation and all those that come after us.
